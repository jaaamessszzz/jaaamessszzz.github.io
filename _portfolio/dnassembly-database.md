Anyone who has worked in the wet lab has struggled with finding a system to keep track of their plasmids and strains.
Originally developed as a web interface for the DNAssembly cloning package, I built an easily deployable website that
facilitate all aspects of planning, assembly, and tracking of my plasmids backed by Django/PostgreSQL. Plasmids can be
planned and assembled all at once, and features and attributes are automatically annotated based on user preference. 
Every plasmid has it's own page where files (e.g. sequencing) and comments can be stored. Plasmids can be downloaded
as Genbank files from the database.
