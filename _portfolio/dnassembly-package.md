Synthetic biology and protein design requires high-throughput assembly of plasmids to rapidly test various designs and 
constructs. However, assembling plasmid sequences by hand can be time consuming and error-prone. I wrote DNAssembly to
automate cloning and assembly of my planned constructs in the wet lab. DNAssembly is capable of performing cloning 
reactions that rely on homology complementation (e.g Gibson, SLIC, CPEC/SOE) or sticky-end (e.g. Golden Gate, BioBrick)
cloning methods. DNAssembly works with GenBank files and keeps track of features and annotations in cloning products.
This package was developed initially to accommodate the [Dueber Lab](https://dueberlab.berkeley.edu/) 
[Yeast TookKit](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/sb500366v) cloning system.

DNAssembly is also now on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dnassembly/)!
