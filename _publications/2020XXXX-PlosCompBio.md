Protein binding to small molecules is fundamental to many biological processes, yet current state-of-the-art methods are
unable to predictively design this functionality de novo. In lieu of existing design methods that rely on existing 
binding site definitions or protein scaffolds with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand, we introduce 
new methods that utilize pools of discrete protein interactions with defined chemical moieties observed in the Protein
Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to recombine residues in a contact pool to generate hundreds of 
thousands of energetically favorable binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding sites are built into 
existing scaffold proteins with high accuracy to impart desired functionality. In addition, we apply observed 
protein-fragment interactions to augment Rosettaâ€™s conventional design machinery and improve key design metrics 
responsible for predicting design success. We demonstrate that our method reliably builds diverse binding sites into 
various scaffold proteins for several target molecules. Our generalizable de novo ligand binding site design method 
will lay the foundation for versatile design of protein to interface previously unattainable molecules for applications 
in medical diagnostics and synthetic biology.
