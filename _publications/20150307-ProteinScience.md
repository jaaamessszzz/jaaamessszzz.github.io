Enzyme active site residues are often highly conserved, indicating a significant role in function. In this study we 
quantitate the functional contribution for all conserved molecular interactions occurring within a Michaelis complex for
mannitol 2‐dehydrogenase derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens (pfMDH). Through systematic mutagenesis of active site 
residues, we reveal that the molecular interactions in pfMDH mediated by highly conserved residues not directly 
involved in reaction chemistry can be as important to catalysis as those directly involved in the reaction chemistry. 
This quantitative analysis of the molecular interactions within the pfMDH active site provides direct insight into the
functional role of each molecular interaction, several of which were unexpected based on canonical sequence 
conservation and structural analyses.
