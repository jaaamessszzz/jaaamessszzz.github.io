Developing Computational Methods for Protein Design
=====

![Fuzzball]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /images/Fuzzball.png %})

I am a fifth-year graduate student in the UC Berkeley/UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering. I performed my 
dissertation research in the lab of Tanja Kortemme at UCSF where I worked with the Rosetta Macromolecular Modeling Suite
to develop computational methods for de novo design of small molecule binding sites in proteins.

I have a solid foundation in both the experimental and computational aspects of protein modeling and design, where my 
primary research interests lie in the rational design of proteins to solve problems in the realm of synthetic 
biology. I also enjoy developing personal projects to help automate lab tasks and facilitate learning through innovative 
teaching tools.
