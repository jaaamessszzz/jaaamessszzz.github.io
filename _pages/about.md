I am a fifth-year graduate student in the UC Berkeley/UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering. I performed my 
dissertation research in the lab of Tanja Kortemme at UCSF where I worked with the Rosetta Macromolecular Modeling Suite
to develop computational methods for de novo design of small molecule binding sites in proteins.

I have a solid foundation in both the experimental and computational aspects of protein modeling and design, where my 
primary research interests lie in the rational design of proteins to solve problems in the realm of synthetic 
biology. To this end, I have worked extensively with the Rosetta code base and mastered several experimental techniques
to probe the function of proteins in a high-throughput manner. Recently, I have started to learn and develop machine 
learning techniques applied to challenging problems in protein design.

I also enjoy developing personal projects to help automate lab tasks and facilitate learning through innovative teaching 
tools. There isn't nearly enough communication between experimentalist and computationalists, and I am doing my best
to bridge the gap.
