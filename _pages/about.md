I am currently a Research Scientist at Nautilus Biotechnology in San Carlos, CA. 

I completed my PhD through the UC Berkeley/UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering, where I performed my 
dissertation research in the lab of Tanja Kortemme. I primarily worked with the Rosetta Macromolecular Modeling Suite
to develop computational methods to design small molecule binding sites into proteins *de novo*.

I have a solid foundation in both the experimental and computational aspects of protein modeling and design, where my 
primary research interests lie in the rational design of proteins to solve problems in the realm of synthetic biology.
I also enjoy developing personal projects to help automate lab tasks and facilitate learning through innovative 
teaching tools.
