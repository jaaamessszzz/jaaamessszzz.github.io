I am a fifth-year graduate student in the UC Berkeley/UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering. I performed my 
dissertation research in the lab of Tanja Kortemme at UCSF where I worked with the Rosetta Macromolecular Modeling Suite
to develop computational methods for de novo design of small molecule binding sites in proteins. 

I have a solid foundation in both the experimental and computational aspects of protein modeling and design. Check out 
my [publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) and projects to learn more about my work!
